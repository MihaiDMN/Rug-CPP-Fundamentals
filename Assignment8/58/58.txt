This exercise asks me to create a class Numbers that holds a fixed number of ints and allow the number of stored ints to be set at construction.
This class needs to have a default constructor, copy constructor and assignment, move constructor and assignment and a destructor.
The output of main.cc is:
$ ./main
n3: 10 10 10 10 10
n4: 10 10 10 10 10
n5: 10 10 10 10 10
n2 (uninitialized): 0 0 0 0 0
When running with valgrind we can observe the output:
Use of uninitialised value of size 8.
