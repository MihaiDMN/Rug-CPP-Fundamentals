This exercise asks me to extend the Strings class so that it can either copy or move its elements when enlarging memory. The main purpose is to compare the speed difference between copying and moving string objects.

time ./strings_test 1000
real    0m0.009s
user    0m0.009s
sys     0m0.000s

time ./strings_test 1000 move
real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.000s
