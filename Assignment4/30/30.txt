This exercise asks us to implement the calculator class which is designed to take the user's input and perform the desired compilation. The calculator must be able to prevent division by 0 and modulo with zero or negative numbers.

We don't need a constructor for the class because, the class does not have any memebers that require initialization and the compiler generates a default constructor.
