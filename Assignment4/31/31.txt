This exercise asks us to use the previously implemented Calculator class and provide an example of it's implementation including how it reacts to invalid inputs.

? 56 + 90
146
? 43 - 73
-30
? 8 * 8
64
? 16 / 4
4
? 9 % 4
1
? 5 / 0
Cannot divide by 0
? 8 % -3
The numbers must be non-zero integers for modulo
? 2 $ 3
Not a valid expression
