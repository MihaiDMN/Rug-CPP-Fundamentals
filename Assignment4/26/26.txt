This exercise asks us to implement the Person class from the C++ Annotations. Additionally we have to create the member function insert which expects an std::ostream, and inserts the information about the person into the ostream that's passed as argument to insert and the member funtion extract which expects an std::istream, and extracts the information from the next line of the istream, where the elements are separated from each other by comma's.
